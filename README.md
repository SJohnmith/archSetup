How to install Python 3.10.5:

    Step 1) Follow these instructions,
    https://www.ubuntumint.com/install-python-arch-linux/
    
    Step 2) 
    If you get the following error,
    arch linux python3.10: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypt.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
    
    Then what this means is,
    Arch Linux being a bit too bleeding-edge for older Python builds. The issue is that Python 3.10.5 is trying to link against libcrypt.so.1, which no longer exists in newer versions of Arch. Arch now uses libxcrypt.so.2, and the older compatibility library isnâ€™t installed by default.
    
    To fix run the following command,
    sudo pacman -S libxcrypt-compat
    
    This should restore the missing shared library and allow Python 3.10.5 to run properly.
    
    Step 3) Verify the installation with,
    python3.10 --version
